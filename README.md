{% hint style="success" %}
#### With WagyuSwap you can trade, stake, and farm tokens with all the _accoutrements_ you've come to expect from a top DeFi platform.
{% endhint %}

## Swap

> Instantly trade your cryptoassets without having to create an account or go through any cumbersome KYC procedures.

### The First DEX on the Fastest Chain

WagyuSwap is the leading decentralized exchange on the Velas Chain, which has been clocked as the fastest blockchain in the world.

### Fees so low they couldn't get on a ride at an amusement park

WagyuSwap runs on Velas Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than both Ethereum, Bitcoin and the Binance Smart Chain. 

Why pay higher fees for slower transactions? 

### Fully Decentralized and Non-custodial

Unlike all the known CeFi platforms and exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, WagyuSwap stays out of your private life and lets you keep you full control of your assets.

## Earn Your $WAG 

> Earn $WAG and other tokens by letting your crypto go to work for you with our sky high interest rates that are sure to leave your mouth watering.

### Stake $WAG to earn free tokens.

$WAG holders can stake their tokens for free to earn millions of dollars' worth of tokens every week from the top projects on Velas Chain. We keep adding new projects to our illustrious menu, so you can monetize your $WAG in an ever-growing number of ways.

### Farm $WAG with our Yield Farms

It's easy: you add liquidity, and stake Liquidity Pools \(LPs\) tokens, and in return you'll earn $WAG. In exchange for becoming more exposed to market fluctuations, you can earn higher APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

If your preferred trading pairs aren't supported on WagyuSwap Farms, you can still earn trading fees by staking your tokens in Liquidity Pools \(LPs\).

## Is WagyuSwap safe?

Yes. And we have the receipts to prove it, courtesy of our [audit by Solidity Finance.](https://solidity.finance/audits/Wagyu/)
