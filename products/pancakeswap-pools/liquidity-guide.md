**How to add liquidity**

You’ll need to add both tokens of the trading pair you'd like to provide liquidity for, with the limit to the liquidity you can provide being the lowest USD value of the two tokens.

Feel free to use our exchange to get your desired tokens. Once you have them, follow these steps:

Go on the Liquidity page and click the "Add Liquidity" button.

Hit ‘Select a currency’ for both fields, pick the tokens you'd like to add liquidity for, and the amount for one in the relevant "Input" field. The other amount will appear instantly.

After you click the "Approve" button, your wallet will require you to confirm your approval. When the "Supply" button appears, click it.
