## Winner Winner Chicken Dinner (How to Win)

How to win is simple: match the numbers on your Lottery ticket (starting with the numbers on the left of your ticket) to the Winning Numbers of the WagyuSwap Lottery. The Winning Numbers are drawn at the end of each Lottery round. If you still donâ€™t understand, donâ€™t worry! we have graphics and more information that will help, but to keep it simple, remember the following

* **Even matching just the first number on your ticket to the Winning Numbers will win you a small prize.**
* **More matching numbers will result in winnings from a bigger prize pool (Must be in order - starting from the left)**

## Prize E**ligibility**

Each ticket has 6 numbers, with each number ranging from 0 to 9. In order to win, the numbers on your ticket need to match the Winning Numbers from the WagyuSwap Lottery draw (very important â€“ this must be in order, starting from the left)

Let's take a look below for an example...

Let's assume the Winning Numbers for the first round of the WagyuSwap Lottery are the following, 7-7-4-2-1-9

![Winning Numbers](../../.gitbook/assets/tickets.png)

While your Lottery ticket numbers are 7-7-4-5-1-9

![Example A - Your Lottery Ticket](../../.gitbook/assets/tickets2.png)

In the example above, your ticket has 5 matching numbers to the Winning Numbers. However, while the first 3 numbers all match, the fourth number **does not** (thereby ending your streak). Thus you would only qualify for Level 3 Prizes, despite having 2 more matching numbers.

Let's take another example ticket, and we shall say your Lottery ticket numbers were 3-7-4-2-1-9

![Example B - Your Lottery Ticket](../../.gitbook/assets/tickets3.png)

This ticket is what we call a burnt steak! As you can see in the second ticket example, there are 5 matching numbers to the Winning Numbers. Still, none of that matters because the **first number on the left** is not the same as the first number of the Winning Numbers. It's brutal, but this ticket wouldn't win anything at all.

So remember, the first number on the left has to match the Winning Numbers for you to have a winning ticket. Additionally, every matching number after that will qualify you for the next Prize Pool Level.

**Don't forget:** The numbers on the ticket must match the Winning Numbers in order, starting from the left!

## P**rize Sharing Across Prize Levels**

Moving on to the juicy part...How much will you win?!?

The winners from the same level only share the Prize Pools. So, for example, Gordan Ramsey had 5 numbers on his ticket that matched the Winning Numbers (in the correct order, starting on the left), lets also assume he was the only person to have 5 matching numbers. As a result, he would receive prizes from the Level 5 Prize Pool, and because he was the only person to qualify for the Level 5 Prize Pool, he would win the entire Level 5 Prize Pool (lucky guy).

Now let's look at Jamie Oliver, and we shall say he had the 2 numbers on his ticket that matched the Winning Numbers (starting from the left). Thus he would only receive prizes from the Level 2 Prize Pool.

It's important to note that just because Gordan Ramsey had 5 numbers in a row doesn't give him access to any Prize Pools other than Level 5. The same can be said about Jamie Oliver and the Level 2 Prize Pool.

The prizes will be awarded after the conclusion of each round of the WagyuSwap Lottery.

After a round finishes and the Winning Numbers have been drawn. You will be able to determine which tickets are the Winning Tickets and thus which Prize Pool Level you qualify for.

The amount each ticket wins will depend on how many other Winning Tickets also qualify for the same Prize Pool Level.

If that didn't make 100% sense to you, step into the Kitchen for an example... Let's say Gordan Ramsey has the only ticket that has 5 matching numbers with the Winning Numbers (once again in order, starting from the left). He would win the entire Level 5 Prize Pool.

â€ŒHowever, if Gordan Ramsey and the entire cast from Master Chef all have tickets with 5 numbers matching the Winning Numbers. Then, the whole Level 5 Prize Pool would be split evenly between all winning tickets.

See the Lottery FAQ for a breakdown of prizes across each Level (Note that the Prize Pools for each level are predetermined at the start of the Lottery)
