## **What if there are no winners?**

We don't waste delicious WAG, and if no one wins, any unclaimed WAG rolls over to the next Lottery round.

## **My ticket matches several numbers but I can't claim a prize**

Tickets are only eligible for prizes if matching numbers start from left. See the Lottery documentation for a more detailed explanation.

## **How are prizes broken down between Prize Pool Levels?**

Each level's prize pool is a portion of the total WAG in each Lottery round

| Prize Pool Level (numbers match in order) | WAG Allocation |
| :---------------------------------------: | :------------: |
|               First 1 Number              |       2%       |
|              First 2 Numbers              |       3%       |
|              First 3 Numbers              |       5%       |
|              First 4 Numbers              |       10%      |
|              First 5 Numbers              |       20%      |
|              First 6 Numbers              |       40%      |
|                    Burn                   |       20%      |

## **Can I swap my tickets back to WAG?**

Once you have purchased a Lottery ticket, you are UNABLE to convert back it to WAG.

## **If I win, do I need to manually claim the prize?**

All prizes need to be claimed. You can do this by clicking the ‘Check Now’ button under 'Are you a winner?'

## **How often is the lottery?**

A new Lottery round starts every 12 hours, giving you the chance to win tons of sizzling prizes.

## **What transaction fee will I pay for buying tickets?**

Transaction fees will be applied to each ticket you purchase. Purchasing a single ticket in the WagyuSwap Lottery will cost the normal fees for a transaction. However, buying more tickets in that purchase will increase the fee. For example, buying 100 tickets rather than 1 will not multiply the fee by 100, but may increase the fee amount by 5-6 times (though this varies).

## **How does the bulk discount work?**

WagyuSwap will be giving you the chance to receive discounts when purchasing multiple tickets. The more tickets you buy, the bigger the discount. However, we cap the number of tickets you can buy at a single time at 100 tickets (this doesn't mean you can't buy more - You can ALWAYS buy more)

## **Why can I only buy 100 tickets?**

You can only buy a maximum of 100 tickets in one purchase. Still, you have an unlimited amount of purchases that you can make. Therefore, you really have an unlimited amount of tickets you can purchase. Still, as mentioned, you can only purchase a maximum of 100 at a time.

## **If I manually create two or more tickets with the same numbers and they win, am I eligible for prizes for each ticket?**

Yes, each ticket is treated as a separate entry in the WagyuSwap Lottery. But please note that the more Winning Tickets will result in a more diluted prize pool (regardless of the amount of matching numbers)**.**

## **Injection schedule: When is WAG added to the lottery?**

When people enter the kitchen and buy WagyuSwap Lottery tickets, the WAG that they spend is added to the lottery pools. In addition, a total of 20,000 WAG is also injected into the lottery pools on a regular schedule over the course of the eight rounds (four days).

The cycle restarts with a new 20,000 WAG as soon as the 8 rounds finish.
